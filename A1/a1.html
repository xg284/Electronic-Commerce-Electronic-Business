<p class="auto-style13">1.a. Our business is aiming to solve the nutrition and 
food preparation problem for fitness people. Customers can use our online 
website to get meal advice from a nutritionist and then order the ingredients 
for those meals all in one place. This is a different service than other 
delivery services. For the ingredients, we will coordinate with some 
supermarkets and directly deliver the ingredients from the supermarkets to the 
customer. </p>
<p class="auto-style13">1.b. Our business will use the recurring revenue stream. 
It involves the customers to continue making payments towards their products and 
services through our business. Our customers will use our nutritionists’ advice 
and purchase their food week to week. These are not one-time payments. There are 
also fees involving delivery and possibly subscriptions. Subscription fees are 
used when customers continue to use our business and eventually could get a 
discount after using it for an extended amount of time. <br />
<br />
2.a. Our competitors are any online food delivery services such as 
Wegmans.Wegmans is a great supermarket that offers many fresh fruits, 
vegetables, meat, and other products. They also offer many organic foods. Except 
for in-store options, they also offer delivery service. Our competitive 
advantages are that we offer nutritionists advice and food delivery services at 
the same time. Customers, especially fitness people can get advice from our 
nutritionists and purchase food using the same website. <br />

<p class="auto-style13">5.a.x Explain: There may be a delay in 
productivity. The reasons for the delay may include learning to use technology, 
adapting the technology to your business and adapting the organization to IT. 
Evidence of the delay includes the increase in productivity 1990-1998 after the 
desktop computing revolution. </p>
<p class="auto-style13">5.b.y Explain: Average productivity does not 
reflect the productivity change in a specific business, as gains and losses 
cancel out. IT is bringing great competitive advantages to some, but destroying 
others. National averages do not tell you the whole story when the population is 
diverse. <br />
<br />
5.c.z Explain: The value of the product is low initially with new products 
because you have few customers. Once you reach a critical mass of customers, the 
value explodes. Until you reach a critical mass of customers, adoption is 
delayed. Network effects lead to delays in adoption. </p>
<p class="auto-style13">6.a.y Explain: Online education has built-in 
interaction with automated questions and answers, and it has asynchronous 
discussion groups using discussion boards. Asynchronous is accessible anytime 
anytime at very low cost. Online education is generally considered to be lower 
quality since it has little personal interaction. It has wider access since 
students can attend lectures remotely and they do not need to move on campus.
<br />
<br />
6.b.w Explain: Low-quality products are often ignored by the dominant firms as 
unprofitable and inappropriate for their brand image, so the newcomers can use 
them as an entry strategy, avoid a competitive reaction, and expand market share 
slowly as the technology improves, and disrupt the whole industry.<br />
<br />
6.c.z Explain: Once you have the shared component in place, expanding into new 
areas is relatively cheap, but the returns are high. For example, databases have 
shared components among many technologies.<br />
<br />
6.d Explain: There may be some disruptive technologies in our business. To 
counter the threat, we would use a constant change strategy. For example, there 
may be some substitutability among the technologies, and we can expand into 
substitute technologies. In addition, if we find another business has synergies 
with our business, we can learn their strategies and expand to new areas. <br />
<br />
7.a.y Explain: (Positive) Network Effects is typically networking and 
communication technologies. A product has (positive) network effects if the 
value of a product to a user increases with the total number of users. <br />
<br />
7.b.w Explain: When the product was first created, no one knows it and moving 
from 0 to non-zero is a big psychological hurdle. Bundling with an established 
product can introduce the product to more customers and help them find the value 
of the product.</p>
<p class="auto-style15">
7.c.z Explain: eBay has many sellers selling a diverse mix of products on the 
site, which attracts a lot of buyers, resulting in an increase in demand and 
prices. The increase in demand and prices attracts more sellers to the 
marketplace. And when more sellers join the platform, supply increases and 
prices decrease, which attracts more buyers to the marketplace. The platforms 
like eBay have an indirect or two-sided network effect that more buyers attract 
more sellers, and more sellers at eBay increase the value of eBay to each 
buyer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style15">8.a.z Explain: At its most basic, mesh networking is a way for users to 
connect directly to other peers in a given area, creating a “mesh” of network 
access points, repeating and bolstering the signal away from a central starting 
point. Most mesh networks democratize the connection, allowing anyone who is 
connected to access anything they’d like to.</p>
<p class="auto-style15">8.b.w Explain: Customers can purchase without direct human scanning. The RFID 
chips can detect everything you put in your cart, show a tab on the screen and 
you can check out by swiping the card at the screen. In this way, retail stores 
do not need to hire so many cashiers. </p>
<p class="auto-style15">8.c.x Explain: The store is outfitted with cameras and shelf sensors to help 
Amazon’s computer vision system work some magic. The technologies, in turn, 
connect the customer and the phone the customer scanned at the entrance with the 
items the customer took from shelves and carried out the door.</p>
<p class="auto-style15">9.a.z Explain: Virtual corporation is a collection of 
loosely coupled businesses that can act as a single firm by rapidly banding and 
disbanding. Since it is a collection of businesses, so answer z defines it best.</p>
<p class="auto-style15">9.b.y Explain: Virtual corporation has advantages such 
as operational efficiency of specialization, and rapid response to opportunities 
and problems. However, it also has disadvantages like a higher coordination cost 
and loss of control.</p>
<p class="auto-style15">9.c.y Explain: According to the reading, e-business does 
not include commercial transactions involving an exchange of value across 
organizational boundaries. E-commerce is not anything digital that a firm does. 
E-business refers to the digital enabling of transactions and processes within a 
firm.</p>
<p class="auto-style15">9.d. Yes, we can convert our business to a virtual 
corporation. Our business involves online advice services from nutritionists and 
delivery services from supermarkets. These two services can be achieved by a 
virtual corporation that links nutritionist sources to give advice regarding 
ingredients and supermarkets able to offer those ingredients and the delivery. 
The virtual corporation may be more efficient to provide customers with the 
ingredients they need.</p>
<p class="auto-style15">10.a.x Explain: Space X needs 
about 400 satellites and each compact Starlink satellite weighs 573lb and 
features a solar array for power.</p>
<p class="auto-style15">10.b.z Explain: From the 
article, we can know that “ALEKS’ machine-learning algorithms are analyzing 
their responses to figure out which concepts they understand and which they 
don’t”. Thus, intelligent books are customized to each student by observing 
student responses and using machine learning.</p>
<p class="auto-style15">10.c.z Explain: From the 
article, we can know that “in the U.S., the credit and debit card system is 
well-established and works just fine for most people.” Therefore, the mobile 
payment did not provide big advantages over this system, people are still 
willing to stay their preference with credit/debit card.</p>
